👋🏽 Hi, I'm Sebastián Rubiano, a Civil engineer from Colombia interested in data science and web development.

👀 Especially interested in back-end development, Data Science.

🌱 I’m currently working with Python building automation scripts to speed up processes using the [Forge API](https://forge.autodesk.com/developer/documentation) and the [BIMTrack API](https://api.bimtrackapp.co/swagger/ui/index#/).

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science and Python Automation projects.
